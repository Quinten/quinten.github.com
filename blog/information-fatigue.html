            <p>Why I always feel exhausted</p>
            <p>A contemporary problem is that we are often overwhelmed with information. Constantly filtering this information is a challenge. The information we receive is often not relevant to us. Blocking out information is a way to deal with this. But this requires an effort from us, draining our energy.</p>
            <p>Also, the information we receive is often biased or even incomplete. This can lead to a distorted view of the world. Often I see people taking in vast amounts of information, thinking they are well informed, but never evaluate or question any of it.</p>
            <p>What is even worse is that the ones who send us this information, are only doing so in their own interest. Because we have to buy something from them, because we have to vote for them, because we have to serve them, because we have think like them.</p>
