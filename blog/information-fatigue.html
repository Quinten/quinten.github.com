            <p>Why I always feel exhausted</p>
            <p>A contemporary problem is that we are often overwhelmed with information. Constantly filtering this information is a challenge. The information we receive is often not relevant to us. Blocking out information is a way to deal with this. But this can also lead to missing out on important information.</p>
            <p>Also, the information we receive is often biased. This can lead to a distorted view of the world. Often I see people taking in vast amounts of information, thinking they are well informed. But during the filtering process, they are simply too lax or they don't filter anything at all.</p>
